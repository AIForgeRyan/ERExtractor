          "E. coli BL21(DE3) was used to express the hexahistidine-labeled SpySystem- appended CYP73A5 and ATR2. Cells were grown at 37°C and 200 rpm in LB medium containing kanamycin for 12 h. After washing twice and resuspending in OD600 of 0.4–0.6, cells were induced with 0.1 mM IPTG at 16°C for 20 h. For CYP73A5 derivatives, 0.5 mM 5-aminovaleric acid (5-AIA) was added. About 400 μL cell cultures were then harvested by centrifugation at 6439 × g and 4°C for 5 min, and resuspended in 1 mL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) in 40 mL Buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 300 mM NaCl). Cell suspension was disrupted in an ice-water bath at 250 W for 30 min with a 1 sec short burst followed by 3 sec rest for cooling using a JY92-2D sonifier (Scientz Biotech, Ningbo, China). The soluble protein, present in the supernatant after centrifugation at 14,489 × g and 4°C for 30 min, was applied for AKTA pure 25 M1 protein purification system with a 5 mL HisTrapTM HP affinity column (Cytiva, MA, USA). Buffer A and Buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 300 mM NaCl, 300 nm imidazole) were used to wash non-specifically bound proteins and elute the tagged target protein via gradually increasing the ratio of Buffer B in the system buffer. The target protein was desalted into stock solution (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 300 mM NaCl, 10% Glycerol) at 3000 × g and 4°C with an Amicon® Ultra-15 centrifugal filter Ultrares™-10 KDa for CYP73A5s and Ultrares®-30 KDa for ATR2s (Merck Millipore, Ireland). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford’s assay [28]."
