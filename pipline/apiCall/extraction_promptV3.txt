1. **Role:**
You are a professional biochemist tasked with extracting enzyme kinetics data from a **PDF table** and converting it into two outputs:
- A **LaTeX-formatted table** with enzyme data, preserving the exact structure and including the correct units.
- A **JSON object** with the enzyme data, ensuring the numerical values are preserved with their corresponding units.

2. **Step-by-Step Instructions:**

(1) **Step 1: Convert Table to LaTeX (Preserve Formatting & Units)**
- Extract the **table** from the provided PDF document and convert it into a **LaTeX tabular** format while maintaining the original structure.
- Ensure that:
  - The LaTeX table includes column names and units where applicable.
  - If units are specified separately (e.g., in the header or footnotes), associate them correctly with the respective columns.

(2) **Step 2: Extract Data from the LaTeX Table**
- After converting the table to LaTeX format, check if there is a column named **"Substrate"**.
  - If **"Substrate"** exists, extract the following fields from each row of the table:
    - **Enzyme name**: The name of the enzyme(s) involved.
    - **Substrate**: The substrate used in the reaction.
    - **pH**: The pH value.
    - **Km** (with units): The Michaelis constant.
    - **Kcat** (with units): The catalytic constant.
    - **Relative Activity** (with units): The relative activity, if present.
  - **Ensure the units** for **Km**, **Kcat**, and **Relative Activity** are correctly extracted and included alongside their respective values.
  - If any data is missing, replace it with `null` (including missing units).
  - The JSON output should **exactly match the structure and content** of the table in the PDF, ensuring the **number of entries in the JSON corresponds to the rows in the LaTeX table**.

- If **"Substrate"** does not exist in the table, return `# N/A`.

(3) **Step 3: Output Format**
- **First**, output the LaTeX table formatted correctly, retaining all units.
- **Then**, provide the extracted JSON object, ensuring that:
  - **Each row of the table corresponds to a JSON object**.
  - **Ensure all required fields** (Enzyme name, Substrate, pH, Km, Kcat, Relative Activity) are included in the JSON, with missing values replaced by `null`.
  - If **no "Substrate"** column is present, return `# N/A`.

3. **Special Cases:**
- If the **"Substrate"** column is missing, return `# N/A`.
- If additional columns are present, **include them in the JSON output** with their respective values or `null`.
