Presumably, the N-terminal bridged architecture of eukaryotic P450 complexes in the native membrane-bound P450-CPR complex in eukaryotic cells, facilitates substrate access and electron transfer-required conformation change. On the other hand, the N-terminal tethering reinforces the protein-protein interactions of the reconstructed eukaryotic P450 system, and may promote the association of the cofactor-binding peptide-based SpySystem-based architectures, the N-terminal bridged architecture of the engineered assemblies. In regard to the distinguished N-termini-appended peptide BioBricks of the SpySystem resulted in a 50.76% decline in the biosynthetic performance of plant CYP73A5-CPR assemblies (Fig. 4), swapping the biosynthetic performance of the Shoopsys panels 2 and 4). The robust biosynthetic performance of SpySystem- tethered CYP73A5-ATR2 performance of the engineered assemblies (Fig. 4 panels 1 and 2) indicates that the biosynthetic performance of the engineered assemblies depends on the forming geometry of the reconstituted components, resulted from the swapping of the level of the reconstructed N-terminal peptide-peptide bridges. The results demonstrate that a well-designed architecture, in terms of the configuration, can impose spatial constraints on either the structural docking of the protein assemblies or the conformational flexibility of the redox partner required for the long-distance electron transfer in eukaryotic P450 system. The potential spatial constraints may be resolved via optimizing the liners between the BioBricks of self-assembled peptide bio-machinery and eukaryotic P450 system. What's suggested in the context is that when the natural topology structure should be considered in priority to learn for designing the spatial architecture of the reconstructed protein assemblies, of which the configuration should not be excluded meanwhile.",
            "description": "The engineered coverable protein assembly paves an alternative way to investigate and unravel the structure-function relationships of membrane protein complexes with various spatial architectures. The membrane-associated protein assemblies are often dynamic and difficult to separate and purify, causing the structure of membrane protein complexes hard to access in practice. Outside the native membrane, membrane proteins often suffer from low expression, poor solubility and high instability, making their recombinant production and structural characterization challenging. Aiming at the membrane anchors, the peptide-based covalent protein assembly can build the counterparts of the membrane protein complexes with some kind architectures, and enable the researchers to purify the recombinant protein complexes via incorporating a proper affinity tag, the bioproduction of human P450 system, and the bioproduction of drug metabolite in E. coli (Fig. 5)."
